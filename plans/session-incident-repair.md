# Session incident repair

## Goal and intention

Repair the reported moderator-report transcript crash and the failures captured by two moderator reports in the stopped session. Determine whether those incidents caused the coordination widget to display idle during tool execution; fix only evidenced causes.

## Scope and constraints

Preserve pre-existing uncommitted Request Attention work. Keep incident evidence outside the repository, redact sensitive content, and do not change installed runtime files without first establishing their relationship to this checkout. No blanket suppression of protocol invariants or speculative UI overrides.

## Work plan

1. Locate the affected session and both reports; inventory independent failures and their timelines.
2. Reproduce the moderator-report projection failure with a targeted regression, then repair its entry contract.
3. Assign remaining evidenced failures to disjoint implementation units, with tests before fixes.
4. Review the combined changes, run focused checks and typechecking, and commit all task-owned changes separately from existing work.

## Validation

Require red/green regression evidence for each implemented bug fix. Use targeted test files instead of the slow full integration suite. Treat the idle screenshot as unresolved unless incident evidence or a faithful reproduction identifies its cause.

## Progress

- Initial UI investigation verified that the coordination widget consumes remote snapshots independently of native Pi Working rendering; existing focused tests passed but no faithful reproduction was available.
- User supplied a moderator-report projection exception and reported two moderator reports. Projection repair and read-only incident retrieval are delegated to separate agents.
- Existing changes span documentation, participant lifecycle/tools, custom entry types, and their tests; these are outside this task's ownership.
- Recovered both reports and the affected Owner/child transcripts. Work-state errors predate report publication; multiple owner observations say settled during an unfinished child tool call. Three stall incidents concern distinct deferred messages, not duplicate moderation of one message.
- First report's deadline-renewal theory is unsupported: Operation Review renewal correctly returns stale for a Delivery Stall's already-completed qualifying Request. No renewal behavior change is warranted.
- Fixed report/read entry classification in commit b304c47. Regression failed on the exact reported invariant before repair; 15 protocol/report tests and the real report publication integration test pass. Typechecking passes.
- Parent reviewed the report change and replayed the actual stopped Owner transcript read-only: 182 entries, both reports readable, two Message deliveries inspectable, repeated refresh succeeds. Original transcripts were not modified.
- Fixed child lifecycle in commit 3993770: Pi awaits extension settlement callbacks before notifying session listeners, so a successor can already be active when an older settlement arrives. Do not forward that obsolete settlement while the native session is streaming.
- A real-process regression reproduces the stale settled status without the guard and passes with it. It checks hosted/explicit/presentation state, deferred delivery eligibility, absence of false stall timing, and restoration of genuine settlement and deadlines. It exercises supported rollover/continuation behavior; no historical native event trace exists to prove the exact stopped-session ordering.
- Final combined targeted run: 17/17 pass across message delivery, moderator reports, report integration, and child settlement continuation. Typechecking and diff checks pass. No full integration suite run.
- Independent focused review found no blocking issues in either fix and verified native Pi event ordering, regression scope, and retained unknown-entry rejection.

## Outcomes and remaining gaps

Both evidenced defects are repaired in the source checkout. The two reports do not justify changing renewal semantics or deduplicating distinct stalled Messages. Pre-existing uncommitted work remains untouched.

After the user deployed those fixes, old-session reload exposed another committed-contract mismatch: lifecycle still emits obligation-resumed, while the delivery reader imported an unexported Request Attention constant. Uncommitted producer/constant renames masked this during earlier validation. New sessions did not contain the offending record; old cold discovery failed before registering the agents command.

Follow-up repair 298bf7e restores the reader to the currently committed producer contract, without accepting a second format or introducing migration logic. A regression uses the real lifecycle producer rather than repeating its custom type. The repair was implemented and validated in a clean temporary worktree: 25 targeted tests and typechecking pass, Pi's extension loader succeeds, and read-only discovery of the actual stopped workflow recovers all five descendants with zero quarantine. Delivery projection succeeds for all six transcripts. The equivalent integrated commit has the same tree; the dirty development tree also passes 29 targeted tests and typechecking.

The in-flight Request Attention rename remains uncommitted, including its matching reader rename; existing development file contents were preserved when integrating the clean repair. Deployment validation must use committed code and the entire affected recovery scope, not only a dirty development tree or the Owner transcript.

The user deployed the follow-up repair and encountered a later initialization failure: Message author result validation failed during canonical Request relationship reconstruction. Discovery and projection acceptance did not cover WorkflowCoordinator.initialize.

Repair 7903314 accepts the currently registered Answer tool's optional resumedRequestMessageId presentation metadata with strict null/nonempty-string validation only for Answer receipts. The exact successful old Answer receipt now reads canonically. No identity, correlation, unknown-key, or other Message-kind validation is relaxed. Test refinement 58b813d verifies canonical roundtripping of actual tool-produced results without coupling the producer test to presentation metadata. Both remaining-obligation scenarios fail against the old validator and pass with the repair.

Full acceptance now uses copies of all six original transcripts and native Pi extension loading, session startup, complete Owner/Coordinator initialization, agents command dispatch/render/close, AgentSession.reload, and agents again. Baseline reproduces the exact author-result failure; the final clean candidate passes with no notifications/diagnostics, all six Agents observable, no model/send/network calls, and unchanged original transcript hashes. Parent reran acceptance on the final clean candidate, whose tree matches integrated 58b813d. This uses the repository's simulated TUI with native Pi Theme, not the physical terminal frontend or the user's other extensions; child activation and workflow continuation were not exercised.

Clean typechecking and all 17 Request resolution tests pass. Four focused producer/metadata tests and typechecking also pass in the preserved dirty development tree. A broader registrar run has one independently reproduced pre-existing Agent Spawn description regex failure; it is unrelated and left unchanged. No full suite run.

All source repairs are committed locally; the installed checkout and original sessions remain untouched by this work. Deploy the integrated fix before the real session's next reload. The unfinished Request Attention feature remains a separate work item; removing current persisted formats there requires its own explicit decision, not compatibility handling silently added here.
