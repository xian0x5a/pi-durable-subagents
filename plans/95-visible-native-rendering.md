# Visible native Agent rendering

## Goal and intention
Make physical visibility own native rendering. Hidden child sessions continue work, IPC and persistence without drawing frames or rebuilding an offscreen terminal. Preserve the visible view and loading feedback until replacement takeover.

## Scope and constraints
Issue #95. Keep xterm for startup diagnostics and test utilities; no generic hidden query responder, session restart, or transcript optimization (#94). Use public Pi TUI stop/start/renderNow APIs. Run targeted tests, never the full suite.

## Work plan
1. Read installed Pi lifecycle APIs and establish failing regression cases at the existing presentation/runtime/PTY seams specified by the issue.
2. Implement visibility transitions, remove detached reconstruction, retain PTY drainage, and separate dimensions from snapshots.
3. Verify real hidden child work/persistence and repeated physical handoff, input, resize, feedback and cleanup.
4. Measure several concurrent real children: render work, PTY bytes and Owner event-loop responsiveness. Keep measurements outside timing-sensitive tests.
5. Update accepted lifecycle docs; review and commit meaningful boundaries.

## Validation
Targeted native-presentation, PTY-projection, physical-attachment and real-child tests; typecheck; diff checks. Real-child benchmark evidence lives under agent artifacts. Structural invariants are assertions; elapsed times are observations only.

## Progress
- Issue requirements and current lifecycle documentation read.
- Code/tests delegated exclusively to visibility-implementation; docs and final review remain with this agent. Benchmark delegated separately with exclusive benchmarks/ ownership.
- Native visibility/PTY/attachment regression slices pass; real hidden-child repeated redraw test passes. Existing native-input integration tests are being converted from stale diagnostic snapshots to explicit physical displays.
- Four-child benchmark completed with durable transcript copies: all-hidden workload has zero render calls/PTY bytes for all children; one visible child has 76 probe renders and 15,013 bytes while three hidden children remain at zero. All eight responses persisted.
- IPC responsiveness p95: 1.387 ms all-hidden, 1.315 ms one-visible (24 samples each); parent event-loop maximum gaps 1.067/0.813 ms. These are proxy observations, not user-perceived latency or before/after speedups.

## Decisions
Native Pi UI data—not an emulated cell grid—is the source of redraw. Hidden PTYs remain drained. Startup negotiation is distinct from admitted hidden presentation.

## Surprises and discoveries
Native-input tests that previously used detached diagnostic snapshots must attach a physical test display. Keeping those snapshots live would contradict the visibility contract. Startup xterm remains diagnostic only after native admission.

## Outcomes
Implementation and targeted checks complete: 65 lifecycle/PTY/launch/hosted tests, 12 real process Runtime tests, 19 interactive-host/compaction/navigation tests and six selected Agent-view tests passed. Typecheck and diff checks passed. Full suite intentionally not run; remaining Agent-view cases and physical-display opt-ins in Owner fork/workflow, supervision and incident tests are adapted but not individually rerun. Evidence is stored under the agent artifacts output for pi-agent-coordination / 2026-09-09 / 95-visible-native-rendering, not in the repository.


## Retrospective
The production simplification removes the detached reconstruction module and most PTY mode machinery. Real native-input tests now use explicit physical terminal displays, rather than asking hidden diagnostic snapshots to behave like a selected view. Measured IPC responsiveness is a proxy; no human-perceived latency or broad freeze-elimination claim is made.

## Follow-up: cancellation ordering and selected-view regressions
Reopened after review reproduced delayed begin/show surviving cancellation and stale hide during A→B→A. First retain failing unit + real-child regressions and fix visibility ordering without delaying Owner restoration. Then diagnose the five remaining Agent-view failures against their observable lifecycle contracts, comparing baseline when needed. Verify the separate operational-incidents powershell tool expectation on baseline but do not change unrelated behavior. Only targeted tests; no PR or push.

- P1 source/runtime/attachment and focused tests exclusively delegated to the original implementor.
- Agent-view failure diagnosis follows P1 completion; baseline comparison and plan maintenance remain with this agent.

### Follow-up outcome
Fixed cancelled pending shows with runtime revision invalidation and serialized same-child release/reselection, without delaying Owner restoration. Three new regressions failed before the fix; surface/launch tests now pass 22/22, and independent review reran the three new regressions successfully with no findings. Typecheck and diff checks pass. Commit: b4fe490.

Three Agent-view failures were test synchronization races: physical selection commands finish at handoff, not later Owner return. Tests now await surface closure; all three affected cases pass. Two remaining failures reproduce on baseline 22f255e: later Runtime configuration preparations time out waiting for transcript response, and terminally failed viewed Run expects an extra model response after its Answer ends the loop. These pre-existing failures remain unchanged. The separate operational-incidents moderator tool expectation also fails on baseline because actual tools include powershell; it remains outside scope.

No full suite, PR or push. Follow-up evidence is under agent artifacts for pi-agent-coordination / 2026-09-10 / p1-cancelled-attachment. An early-startup IPC response can persist before native transcript subscription begins; the retained cancellation regression verifies persistence plus current widgets/editor on reattach, not that separate early-response screen behavior.
