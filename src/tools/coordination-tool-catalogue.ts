const AGENT_MESSAGE_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<agent_message>
For send and request, targetAgent accepts an exact Agent label, full Agent ID, or unique Agent ID suffix. Full IDs and suffixes resolve Workflow-wide. Labels resolve only among the caller, its Direct Spawner, and its direct children; Owner and Moderator labels resolve Workflow-wide. An ambiguous target is rejected rather than guessed.

When agent_message returns messageStatus "sent", the Message was admitted for asynchronous Delivery and may still be queued; it does not mean delivered. An initial request returning "not_sent" creates no Request or dependency: correct the problem and author a new Request rather than retrying its correlation ID. "unknown" preserves uncertain admission; inspect the same identity. Later retry failures do not withdraw an admitted Request.

A delivered Agent Request, including a Creation Request, creates one Answer obligation. Every Request requires a short, specific title identifying the work; its full body remains authoritative. Request ordering controls attention, not execution order: choose which delivered unresolved Request to work on or answer.

${COORDINATION_HISTORY_GUIDANCE}

While any Answer obligation remains, agent_message operation "send" to its requester is rejected. Keep provisional findings local. Use "answer" for the curated result, or issue a reverse "request" when requester input or a decision is needed. Ordinary "send" to other Agents remains available.

agent_message operation "answer" requires requestId (any delivered unresolved Request ID or a unique case-sensitive suffix) and answer text. Use it as the only tool call in its turn. It resolves only the named obligation and ends the current model/tool loop. Any later continuation leaves the remaining work order to you. Do not add an assistant-message recap or summary.

An Answer receipt with disposition "committed" and delivery "omitted" resolves the local obligation without Answer Delivery because the original Request source is unavailable. It is not failed commitment, Delivery proof, or permission to repeat the work.

In your Answer, summarize completed work with enough context for the requester to avoid repeating it, e.g. relevant artifacts, checks or reviews already performed and their scope and outcomes, and remaining gaps.

agent_message operation "send" creates no Answer expectation. Continue normally and poll only when Delivery proof matters.
For poll/retry messageId and cancel requestMessageId, use the full ID or a unique case-sensitive suffix from your own earlier authored Messages (including Creation Requests). Ambiguous suffixes fail; use a longer suffix or the full ID. Receipts retain full canonical IDs.
</agent_message>`;

const MESSAGE_DELIVERY_RULES = "deferred (default): Messages enter at settlement; Requests also enter at agent_wait, one at a time in FIFO order. steer: delivers an admission-ordered batch at the next safe boundary, after active generation and its tool batch finish, ahead of Deferred. Steer Messages, Requests, or Cancellations preempt agent_wait with the eligible Steer batch. background: enters only at settlement with no Answers owed and no eligible higher-priority delivery; never preempts agent_wait. Background Messages and Requests share FIFO order and may starve.";

// Stated once here rather than once per authoring operation: the schema repeats any
// field both authoring operations accept, and this rule text is long.
const DELIVERY_MODE_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<delivery_modes>
${MESSAGE_DELIVERY_RULES}
</delivery_modes>`;

const AGENT_DELEGATION_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<agent_delegation>

When agent_message operation "request" or agent_spawn delegates work, partition it into bounded, non-overlapping work units before sending the Request.

Reuse an existing Agent with agent_message operation "request" only when context acquired through its earlier work materially reduces rediscovery. When useful, set contextPreparation with both workScale and contextDependence so the idle recipient can prepare a bounded working zone before Delivery. Omit it to keep ordinary Pi compaction behavior. Spawn a fresh Agent when prior context is not relevant to the new work.

After either tool returns requestMessageId with messageStatus "sent", the responder owns the delegated work until its Answer arrives or the Request is cancelled. Continue only explicitly disjoint work that would still be needed if the responder returned a complete, correct Answer. Otherwise end the turn. The runtime waits for turn-triggering input and continues the existing flow when it arrives. Intentional duplicate investigation is appropriate only when the Request explicitly asks for an independent cross-check.
</agent_delegation>`;

const AGENT_WAIT_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<agent_wait>
Use agent_wait when one next decision needs a set of Answers together. With no arguments it joins all your outstanding outbound Requests. Optional requestMessageIds selects a non-empty list of your authored Requests using full IDs or unique case-sensitive suffixes, not incoming obligations. Choose only dependencies that can progress without an Answer you still owe. If strict fan-in is unnecessary, let ordinary Answer Delivery reactivate you; do not poll or use Wait to monitor ordinary progress. Ordinary Messages do not satisfy Requests.

Primary interactive human input or eligible inbound delivery may preempt agent_wait. If it returns disposition "preempted", consider the new input and choose what needs attention next. Preemption consumes no Answers and creates no Answer Delivery proof. If a join is still needed, call agent_wait again with the desired selection; each call fixes a fresh snapshot.
</agent_wait>`;

const AGENT_SPAWN_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<agent_spawn>
A successful agent_spawn returns spawnStatus "created", confirming that the child exists. Its Creation Request requires its own title, independent of the Agent label, and follows the shared Agent Delegation rules.

Children have isolated context. Pass needed context explicitly in the Creation Request.
</agent_spawn>`;

const AGENT_OBSERVE_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<agent_observe>
For status, agentId accepts a full Agent ID, unique Workflow-wide ID suffix, or exact label within your observation scope. Labels do not grant additional observation authority; ambiguous selectors are rejected. Omit agentId to observe yourself.
To locate the transcript for the caller or an authorized Agent, use primaryEvidence.transcriptPath from an operation "status" result. A null path means the session is not file-backed.
</agent_observe>`;

const AGENT_CONTROL_PROMPT_GUIDE = `<agent_control>
Choose by intent:
- Pause a Run to redirect it: operation "interrupt", then "resume" with new instructions.
- Stop what an Agent is doing now: operation "abort". It ends only the current Run. The Agent, its Requests, and its descendants remain, and a later Message starts a successor Run.
- Change a child's model or thinking without losing its context: operation "set_model" with the same model pair as agent_spawn config.model. A running child switches at its next model request; a child without a Runtime starts its next one on it. The receipt names the selection and the thinking level it runs.
- Withdraw work you no longer need: agent_message operation "cancel" on your Request. Abort never cancels Requests, so aborted work you authored stays outstanding until you cancel it or it is answered.

An abort receipt's callerOutstandingRequests lists your unresolved Requests to that Agent; residualRequests counts all of that Agent's unresolved incoming and outgoing Requests. A queued child has no Run, so abort reports "not_running" and the child still boots later unless you cancel its Creation Request.

If the aborted work remains needed, reactivate the same Agent with an ordinary Message instead of cancelling. Otherwise cancel it before delegating replacement work or calling agent_wait.
</agent_control>`;
